AIR is AMQP Interoperable RPC
=============================

When using AMQP to handle the majority of inter-system comms it is
sometimes useful to allow point-2-point RPC-like calls.

AIR provides a simple framework that allows request/response messages
to be sent via AMQP.

At the AMQP level services are addressed using a pre-shared routing
key (which may be shared) and replies are sent to an ad-hoc UUID using
the standard AMQP reply-to header.

AIR uses json to encode args in the RPC call/response.

The AIR calling wrapper contains a message ID, parameters and a deadline.

The AIR response wrapper contains a message ID and the response.

INSTALL
